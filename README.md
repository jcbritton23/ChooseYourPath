Choose Your Path: Embracing Thorny Topics in Therapy

This project is an interactive, browser-based simulation designed for therapists, counselors, trainees, and other mental health professionals to practice navigating challenging conversations related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), bias, and microaggressions in a clinical setting.

## Description

The simulation presents users with realistic client scenarios involving sensitive topics. Users take on the role of the therapist and make dialogue choices that influence the session's direction. The goal is to provide a safe space to:

*   Practice applying specific therapeutic models relevant to these conversations.
*   Observe potential client reactions to different interventions.
*   Reflect on the effectiveness and potential impact (including harm or repair) of chosen responses.
*   Increase awareness and skill in handling "thorny topics" that often arise in therapy.

## Purpose / Learning Objectives

*   To provide practice opportunities for addressing client statements related to race, bias, and DEI discomfort.
*   To simulate the recognition and repair of potential therapist microaggressions.
*   To apply principles from specific therapeutic models (Drustrup, Warner LET-UP) in relevant scenarios.
*   To differentiate between generally supportive responses and model-aligned interventions.
*   To encourage reflection on therapist decision-making and its impact on the therapeutic alliance.
*   To foster increased comfort and competence in navigating difficult dialogues related to cultural humility and social justice in therapy.

## Features

*   **Two Distinct Scenarios:** Choose between working with "Alex" (addressing DEI discomfort) or "Maya" (navigating potential microaggression and repair).
*   **Branching Dialogue:** Your choices directly impact the client's responses and the session's flow.
*   **Model Integration:** Scenarios are designed around specific therapeutic models (Drustrup, Warner LET-UP).
*   **Model Key:** Toggle a pop-up window during the session to review the steps of the relevant therapeutic model.
*   **Randomized Choices:** The order of response options is randomized to encourage careful reading over pattern recognition.
*   **Variable Choice Number:** Decision points offer 2-4 choices, reflecting conversational flexibility.
*   **Session Summary:** Receive feedback at the end of each path detailing which model steps were engaged (or missed) and reflecting on the potential impact on the therapeutic alliance.
*   **Reflection Input:** A space provided at the end to jot down personal takeaways (note: this text is not saved).
*   **Standalone HTML:** Runs entirely in a web browser; no server or installation required.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Core Concepts & Models

This simulation integrates principles from the following models:

### 1. Drustrup's Model for Addressing Racism with White Clients

*   **(Scenario: Alex)** Focuses on guiding white therapists in ethically and clinically addressing racism when it appears in sessions with white clients.
*   **Key Interactive Steps Practiced:**
    *   Listen, Empathize, Validate Emotion (without validating racist content)
    *   Explore Racial Consciousness (experiences, beliefs related to race/whiteness)
    *   Connect to Client Concerns (linking race talk to presenting problems/goals)
    *   Psychoeducation (offering info/perspectives carefully)
    *   Encourage New Perspectives (suggesting resources/reflection)
*   *(Based on: Drustrup, D. (2020). White therapists addressing racism in psychotherapy: an ethical and clinical model for practice. Ethics & Behavior, 30(3), 181-196.)*

### 2. Warner's LET-UP Model for Microaggression Response/Repair

*   **(Scenario: Maya)** Focuses on therapist awareness, response, and repair when a potential microaggression occurs in the therapeutic relationship.
*   **Key Steps Practiced:**
    *   **L**isten (Internal therapist reaction & external client cues; Acknowledge misstep)
    *   **E**mpathize (Validate client feeling; Apologize for impact)
    *   **T**ell Story (Strategic, brief self-disclosure for repair, used cautiously)
    *   **U**nderstand (Explore impact/meaning for the client & broader context)
    *   **P**sycho-educate (Offer info on microaggressions/bias post-repair, if helpful)
*   *(Based on concepts presented by Dr. Ryan C. Warner regarding microaggression response and repair, often emphasizing listening, empathy, understanding impact, and appropriate action/dialogue.)*

## Scenarios

1.  **Alex:** A mid-30s white male manager initially seeking therapy for workplace stress. He expresses discomfort and anxiety around his workplace's DEI initiatives, fearing judgment and saying the "wrong thing." This scenario focuses on applying the **Drustrup model** to explore his experiences, underlying beliefs, and connection to his presenting anxiety without causing undue rupture.
2.  **Maya:** A late-20s Black female designer experiencing burnout and imposter syndrome. She describes workplace dynamics where her contributions feel overlooked. The session *begins* with a potential therapist microaggression (forced positivity/minimizing). This scenario focuses on applying the **Warner LET-UP model** to recognize the misstep, engage in authentic repair, validate Maya's experience, and rebuild the alliance.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Clone or download this repository/the HTML file.
2.  **Open:** Navigate to the downloaded folder and open the `indexgoogle (1).html` file (or whatever you have named it) directly in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  **Interact:** Read the prompts and choose the therapeutic responses you think are most appropriate. Observe the unfolding dialogue and the final summary feedback.
4.  **Reflect:** Use the simulation as a tool for learning and personal reflection on your own potential responses and biases.

## Disclaimer

This simulation is intended solely as an **educational tool** for practice and reflection by mental health professionals and trainees.

*   It is **not** a substitute for formal clinical training, supervision, consultation, or personal therapy.
*   The scenarios are simplified representations and cannot capture the full complexity of real human interaction or therapeutic relationships.
*   The "correctness" of choices is based on alignment with the specific theoretical models presented for pedagogical purposes and may not represent the only valid therapeutic approach in a real-life situation.
*   Clinical judgment is always required in actual practice.
*   **No user data or reflection text entered is saved or transmitted.**

Use this tool to enhance awareness, practice specific skills, and stimulate reflection on cultural humility and responsive therapeutic practice.

## Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas)

*   Add more diverse scenarios and client presentations.
*   Incorporate additional therapeutic models.
*   Develop more complex branching narratives.
*   Add options for saving reflections locally (using browser storage).
